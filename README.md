 <summary><h3>Janese's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
	I started my coding journey when I was hired by Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) as a contractor in 2020. I was tasked with revamping their existing Access databases for managing material inventory. I had some cursory knowledge of Access, but I had not delved into the weeds of Visual Basic, database design, concurrency control or any of the other knowledge required to be a database administrator. Within 6 months, I taught myself VBA (and by "taught myself" I mean spent 10+ hours everyday watching YouTube and Udemy videos) and learned how to create, structure and maintain the Access tools I had been assigned. During that time, I also created a completely new Access database that allowed our compliance branch to locate and update the records of nearly $750,000 worth of material and it is still being used as a material system of record to this day. Because of the immense success of that project, I was offered a full-time position directly with NNSY after only 6 months of being employed as a contractor. VBA was my first exposure to coding and figuring out how to solve problems with code was absolutely exhilarating. I became addicted to learning everything I could about the programming world and branched out into Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++ and many other languages. I'm a bit of a unicorn at my job and I'd love to find a company where I can be amongst my peers and continue to learn and apply my knowledge in new and exciting ways. Because of my drive and passion I can confidently say that I am well on my way to becoming one of the best in the field. Remember my name!
